# Guide to coordinated vulnerability disclosure for open source software projects


This repository is a set of resources and reference materials to help open source projects perform coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD).


## This repository contains:

* **[Guide to coordinated vulnerability disclosure for open source software projects](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/maintainer-guide.md):** This contains background material on vulnerability disclosure, the steps to the CVD process, considerations for the decision points of the process, and "troubleshooting" for common scenarios.
* **[Guide to coordinated vulnerability disclosure for Finders working with open source software projects](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/finder-guide.md):** Focused on security researchers (aka "Finders"), this contains background material on vulnerability disclosure, the steps to the CVD process, considerations for the decision points of the process, and "troubleshooting" for common scenarios.
* **[Templates](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/tree/main/templates):** These will help you get started with the communication components of CVD. This includes [`SECURITY.md` templates](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/tree/main/templates/security_policies), [embargoed notification](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/templates/notifications/embargo.md) and [vulnerability disclosure](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/templates/notifications/disclosure.md).
* **[Runbook](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/runbook.md):** A step-by-step list for the CVD process. For additional information on these steps, refer to the [Guide](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/guide.md).

## Getting Started

If you are new to coordinated vulnerability disclosure, it is recommended you start with the [Guide](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/guide.md). While it is dense, you will want to be familiar with this information and the concepts presented *before* you need to address a vulnerability report. 

If you are familiar with coordinated vulnerability disclosure, you can get a refresher by skipping to the [Response Process](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/guide.md#response-process) section of the Guide, or go straight to the [Runbook](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/runbook.md).
